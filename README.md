## Astrology-Sabian-Symbols

This was done for my other, who believes in this kind of thing. Unfortunately, I no longer have the original text file, but it was a bad copy of a book that I found for free online, and I used python to clean it up and turn it into a list of tab seperated values. The idea is that each degree of the zodiac has a special meaning, which has been "chanelled" by some guy. This can be used to gain further insight into your chart, by looking up the specific degrees of your chart (this is accomplished in the program by clicking on the degree and sign to elect them yourself), or a randomly chosen degree can be used as an "oracle" for the moment (This can be done by holding the left mouse button over the square in the bottom right hand corner for a desired length of time).

I don't believe in any of this, and unfortunately, I no longer have the original text file or the python scripts I used to clean it.I did not edit the text,apart from removing double spaces, so there are some gramattical errors, and there are some missing entries, from the original.

Skills: Data cleaning (text manipulation), Basic Pygame usage
